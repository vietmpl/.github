Vie (French: `/vi/`, meaning "life") is a lightweight toolkit for code
generation, designed to make creating and reusing templates simple and
efficient.

## Key Features

* Vie CLI – the heart of the ecosystem, providing all the tools needed for
  writing and rendering templates.

* Vie Template Language – own template language with static types,
  allowing variables to be inferred automatically without additional type definitions.

* Editor Integrations – plugins for VSCode, Neovim, and Zed make it easy to use
  Vie directly in your development environment.
